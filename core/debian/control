Description: Powerful, web-based mailing list manager
 The GNU Mailing List Manager, which manages email discussion lists
 much like Majordomo and Smartmail. Unlike most similar products,
 Mailman gives each mailing list a web page, and allows users to
 subscribe, unsubscribe, etc. over the web.  Even the list manager can
 administer his or her list entirely from the web.
 .
 Mailman also integrates most things people want to do with mailing
 lists, including archiving, mail <-> news gateways, and so on.  It
 has all of the features you expect from such a product, plus
 integrated support for the web (including web based archiving),
 automated bounce handling and integrated spam prevention.
 .
