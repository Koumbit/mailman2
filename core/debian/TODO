Changes outlined herein being a major deviation from the way Mailman
is packaged now, it might be wiser to defer them until sarge+1.

- Split into mailman, mailman-bin, mailman-doc, mailman-i18n.
  Changed mind: let the main package be arch-indep and depend on
  arch-dep mailman-bin containing the wrapper binaries.

- mailman.postinst should be better at building a new mm_cfg.py from
  an existing configuration, in particular at removing obsolete vars.
  As it stands, a python postinst (using code inspection if needed)
  seems to be the way to go.

  For a starting point on how to detect user modifications to
  mm_cfg.py, see debian/snippets/user_cfg.py

- Rewrite qmail-to-mailman.py to read configuration from mm_cfg.py
  like postfix-to-mailman.py does, getting it out of /etc/mailman and
  the ucf database.

- As far as I(bsb) am concerned, I'd even prefer separate source
  packages for mm-spamassassin, mm-spamprobe, mm-savannah and
  mm-clamav but with spamassassin and savannah already being in the
  archive, somebody will probably object :(

- Make lintian clean.

- mailman-i18n:
  $LANG/LC_MESSAGES/mailman.mo should go into /usr/share/locale.

  If not installed, admin pages dealing with multilingual support must
  be replaced by a hint to install mailman-i18n first.

  The main package will only support english, no inclination to prefer
  any particular language over the others. I'd even prefer calling it
  the C locale, let's see if renaming (and providing a link when -i18n
  is installed) works.

- Upstream check_perms reports nonesense, there is no point in making
  e.g. language directories 2775.  Either rewrite it such that it
  provides sensible results or drop it completely (when invoked with
  -f it even enforces that nonsense).


This list is by no means meant to be complete.
