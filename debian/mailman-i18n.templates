_Description: Which languages to support?  
 For each supported language Debian Mailman stores default language
 specific texts in /etc/mailman/LANG/ giving them conffile like
 treatment with the help of ucf.  This means approximately 150kB for
 each supported language on the root FS.
 .
 If you need a different set of languages at a later time, just run
 dpkg-reconfigure mailman.
 .
 NOTE: Languages enabled on existing mailing lists are forcibly
 reenabled when deselected and mailman needs at least one language for
 displaying it's messages.
