Changes outlined herein being a major deviation from the way Mailman
is packaged now, it might be wiser to defer them until sarge+1.

- Split into mailman, mailman-common, mailman-doc, mailman-i18n.
  installing $LANG/LC_MESSAGES/mailman.mo in /usr/share/locale.

- mailman-common.postinst should be better at building a new mm_cfg.py
  from an existing configuration, in particular at removing obsolete
  vars.  As it stands, a python postinst (using code inspection if
  needed) seems to be the way to go.

- Rewrite qmail-to-mailman.py to read configuration from mm_cfg.py
  like postfix-to-mailman.py does, getting it out of /etc/mailman and
  the ucf database.

- As far as I(bsb) am concerned, I'd even prefer separate source
  packages for mm-spamassassin, mm-spamprobe, mm-savannah and
  mm-clamav but with spamassassin and savannah already being in the
  archive, somebody will probably object :(

- Make lintian clean.

This list is by no means meant to be complete.
