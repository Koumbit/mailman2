This package 'mailman' contains the legacy 2.x branch of Mailman.
Development happens in the Mailman 3 suite, available in Debian via
the 'mailman3' metapackage.

The 'mailmam' 2.x package is in maintenance mode. It will be kept in
(minimal) working order for the foreseeable future, but will not see
any major changes or improvements.

Therefore it's likely not useful to file wishlist bugs, feature
requests or items requiring major changes to the packaging.
